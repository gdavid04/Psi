# Experimental feature branches

### [better-error-catcher](https://github.com/gdavid04/Psi/tree/better-error-catcher)
[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/download-better--error--catcher-9cf)](Psi 1.16 better-error-catcher.jar)  
Changes Error Catcher to output the error handled value instead of replacing the result of its target.  
Preview of what Error Catcher could become after 1.18 port.

### [entity-eye-position](https://github.com/gdavid04/Psi/tree/entity-eye-position)
Changes Operator: Entity Position to always return foot position and adds Operator: Entity Eye Position.  
Might be merged after 1.18 port.

### [empty-cad-slot](https://github.com/gdavid04/Psi/tree/empty-cad-slot)
Adds an always empty slot to CADs, similar to tools and armor.  
Unlikely to be merged because "an odd number of slots looks cursed".

### [collapse-block-output](https://github.com/gdavid04/Psi/tree/collapse-block-output)
Changes Trick: Collapse Block to output the falling block entity created by the trick.

# Misc experiment branches
These have a zero chance of being merged and tend to be buggy.  
I made most of them to test super weird ideas that would never be implemented otherwise.

### [two-params-per-side](https://github.com/gdavid04/Psi/tree/two-params-per-side)
Allows two parameters to share a side.

### [big-grid](https://github.com/gdavid04/Psi/tree/big-grid)
Increases the spell grid size to 13x13  
The programmer GUI is buggy.

### [hexa-grid](https://github.com/gdavid04/Psi/tree/hexa-grid)
Changes the spell grid to consist of hexagons instead of squares.  
The programmer GUI, connector lines and bandwidth calculation are very buggy.
