# Experimental feature branches

### better-error-catcher
Changes Error Catcher to output the error handled value instead of replacing the result of its target.  
Preview of what Error Catcher could become after 1.18 port.

### entity-eye-position
Changes Operator: Entity Position to always return foot position and adds Operator: Entity Eye Position.  
Might be merged after 1.18 port.

### empty-cad-slot
Adds an always empty slot to CADs, similar to tools and armor.  
Unlikely to be merged because "an odd number of slots looks cursed".

### collapse-block-output
Changes Trick: Collapse Block to output the falling block entity created by the trick.

# Misc experiment branches
These have a zero chance of being merged and tend to be buggy.  
I made most of them to test super weird ideas that would never be implemented otherwise.

### two-params-per-side
Allows two parameters to share a side.

### big-grid
Increases the spell grid size to 13x13  
The programmer GUI is buggy.

### hexa-grid
Changes the spell grid to consist of hexagons instead of squares.  
The programmer GUI, connector lines and bandwidth calculation are very buggy.
